# Hi there! Welcome to the readme section!

This is the api for our CSE215 term project(incomplete ofc).

Here is a [guide](https://easynotsoeasy.notion.site/VendorVista-65ebde5eed254660ac6dce7b6786de71) to the PL/SQL written for this project. 

This api uses Djano-rest-framework but it does not use the ORM. DB schema, user auth and other relevant things are done manually.
